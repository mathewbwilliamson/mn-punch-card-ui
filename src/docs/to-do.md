# FIXES

- Add a link to the product! Adjust margin top to image, margin bottom away from image.
- Sort products by price, low to high

# Improvements and Tasks

- Add a Refresh All button
- Create a yml file for API deployment
- Remove all comments and console logs
- Auth for Admins in UI and in API
- Button on each product so that a kid can order it. It will open a popup that says contact Julie and Autumn to let the know you want this. Eventually, have logins for students so they can ACTUALLY order it. It will track their punch cards then let them order it.
- Auth for kids and instructors
- Instructor dashboard that lists out all the students and allows them to increase their punch card count or decrease their punch card count. Add a dialog box for are you sure?
- Change buttons to be less aggressive but more design-y. Look into vettery and ant design.
