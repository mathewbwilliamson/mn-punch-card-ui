# BEFORE INITIAL RELEASE

- Add a link to the product! Adjust margin top to image, margin bottom away from image.
- Sort products by price, low to high
- Not able to include duplicates on the New Product list
- Add a Refresh All button
- BEFORE initial release: Have a button to send Autumn and Julie an email with what the kids want. Popup a little popup that says "Tell Julie and Autumn about this product": what they want, student first/last name, parent first/last name, shipping address, Parent's email address, Parent Approval checkbox. "I understand that I spending X punch cards on this item, and there are no refunds. Are you sure you want this?" Then form emails to Julie and Autumn.
- Remove all comments and console logs
- Add in new logos and designs

# Improvements and Tasks

- Create a yml file for API deployment
- Auth for Admins in UI and in API
- Button on each product so that a kid can order it. It will open a popup that says contact Julie and Autumn to let the know you want this. Eventually, have logins for students so they can ACTUALLY order it. It will track their punch cards then let them order it.
- Auth for kids and instructors
- Instructor dashboard that lists out all the students and allows them to increase their punch card count or decrease their punch card count. Add a dialog box for are you sure?
- Change buttons to be less aggressive but more design-y. Look into vettery and ant design.
